Customer churn is a major problem and one of the top issues for big businesses.
Customers in the telecom industry can actively switch between operators and have
access to a wide range of service providers. Customer retention has now surpassed
customer acquisition in importance due to the fact that it is 5–10 times more expensive to gain new customers than to keep existing ones. Retaining highly profitable
customers is the top business objective for many established operators. To reduce
customer churn, telecom businesses must identify the consumers who are most likely
to leave.
Therefore, finding factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. The main contribution of our work is to develop
a churn prediction model which assists Lu’s communication to predict customers who
are most likely subject to churn. The model developed in this work uses machine
learning techniques on big data platforms and builds a new way of features’ engineering and selection. Four different machine-learning models are applied to Lu’s
Communication dataset which are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and Random Forest. After applying all the models we realise that the random
forest model has the highest accuracy of 94% out of all the models.
